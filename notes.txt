Our AutoML model consists of four main components.

the first component is the augmentation bloc, 
this takes in the synthetic data as input and attempts to augment it, using the provided parameters, to look more realistic.

The second component is the UNet model which is trained on this augmented data.

The 3rd component completes the feedforward portion of the pipeline, and is the validation block.
This block validates the trained UNet against our real world data and outputs an error score.

And finally we have our feedback coponents, which takes the feedforward's output error, and uses it
to find the enxt set of optimized hyperparams to be fedback to our augmentation block for the next iteration.

This final component was implemented 2 different ways. 
The first method used an open source AutoML tool, called SMAC3, to carry out Bayesian optimization.
